# Solutions - Debugging Challenge

## Bug 1: Type Mixing in Decimal Arithmetic
**Location:** `processor.py:24`

**Problem:**
```python
self.daily_totals[date] = self.daily_totals[date] + transaction['amount']
```
When `transaction['amount']` is not a Decimal, this creates a new object with mixed types, potentially losing precision.

**Fix:**
```python
self.daily_totals[date] += Decimal(str(transaction['amount']))
```
Or ensure the transaction amount is converted to Decimal before this operation.

## Bug 2: Data Encapsulation Violation
**Location:** `processor.py:30`

**Problem:**
```python
return [t for t in self.transactions if t['date'] == date]
```
Returns a new list, but the dictionaries inside are still references. External code can modify the original transaction objects.

**Fix:**
```python
return [t.copy() for t in self.transactions if t['date'] == date]
```
Return copies of the transaction dictionaries to prevent external modification.

## Bug 3: Incorrect Boolean Logic in Validation
**Location:** `validator.py:10`

**Problem:**
```python
if not all(field in transaction or field for field in required_fields):
```
The `or field` makes this always True since field strings are truthy. This validation always passes.

**Fix:**
```python
if not all(field in transaction for field in required_fields):
```
Remove the `or field` to properly check if all required fields exist.

## Bug 4: Missing Type Conversion for Amounts
**Location:** `validator.py:18-19`

**Problem:**
```python
if not isinstance(transaction['amount'], (int, float, Decimal)):
    return False
```
Accepts amounts but doesn't convert them to Decimal, allowing float imprecision into the system.

**Fix:**
```python
if not isinstance(transaction['amount'], (int, float, Decimal)):
    return False

transaction['amount'] = Decimal(str(transaction['amount']))
```
Convert amounts to Decimal during validation to ensure precision throughout.

---

## Bug 5: Integer Division Precision Loss
**Location:** `calculator.py:15`

**Problem:**
```python
return total / len(amounts)
```
When `len(amounts)` is an int, Python 3 performs float division, but we need Decimal precision.

**Fix:**
```python
return total / Decimal(len(amounts))
```
Convert the divisor to Decimal to maintain precision in the result.
